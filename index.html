   <h3 id="tribute-info"> Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life</h3>
   <ul>
       <li> <b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa  <br>  <br></li>

       <li> <b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks <br> 
        to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration" <br> <br> </li>

       <li> <b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br> 
        Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br> 
        them", he said. "All of this left scars on me." <br> <br> </li>

        <li> <b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service <br> <br> </li>

        <li> <b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget <br> 
         cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br>
         Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants. <br> <br> </li>

         <li> <b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br>
         rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT <br>
          to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science. <br> <br> </li>

         <li> <b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology <br> <br> </li>

         <li> <b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br>
         pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. <br>
          Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease <br>
           resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth. <br> <br> </li>

           <li> <b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat <br>
         yields <br> <br> </li>

         <li> <b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <br>
         American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to <br>
          provide 95% of Mexico's wheat. <br> <br></li>

          <li> <b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian <br>
         subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly <br>
          expanding population <br> <br></li>

          <li> <b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize <br> <br> </li>

            <li> <b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and <br>
         sorghum yields <br> <br></li>

         <li> <b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University <br> <br></li>

            <li> <b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues <br>
         that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as <br>
          we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous <br>
           because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long <br>
            time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds." <br> <br> </li>

         <li> <b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95. <br> <br> </li> 
     </ul>
       <div class="life" >"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution <br>
         that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to <br>
          human peace and progress." <br> <br>
